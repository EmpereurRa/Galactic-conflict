The songs I got are part of the soundtrack that appears in "The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"
The sound effect for explosions is from a friend, known often as sincaster, jokerul or such.
A classmate made the spaceship and shots look as they do, so hey, thank you, 
I won't come trough the window at night anytime soon.
